# tt-llk: CPP Low Level Kernels (LLK) & test infrastructure #

## Overview
This repository contains low level kernels for Tenstorrent AI chips (Grayskull (deprecated), Wormhole_B0, and Blackhole), which represent foundational primitives of compute used as building blocks for higher level software stacks that implement ML OPs. Alongside the kernels is a test environment used for validating LLK APIs.

LLKs are header-only.
